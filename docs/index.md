## Recipes

Warewulf recipes are designed to be brief command based walk throughs of what you would need to type or do to reach a particular endpoint. If you need details of what you are doing, why you are doing it, or how something works, this is not the place! Contributions should be in the form of specific command examples such that somebody can for the most part copy/paste the content to obtain the desired results with only brief explanations (if any).
